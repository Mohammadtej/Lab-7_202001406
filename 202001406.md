## Section A

### Program 1

There are three parameters, i.e., day, month and year, in this problem, so there will be separate equivalence classes for each parameter.

Equivalence Classes:
1. Date
Valid: 1 ≤ day ≤ 31 Invalid: day < 1, day > 31
2. Month
Valid: 1 ≤ month ≤ 12
Invalid: month < 1, month > 12
3. Year
Valid: 1900 ≤ year ≤ 2015 Invalid: year < 1900, year > 2015
 

#### Test Cases:
1. Equivalence Partitioning
 
In equivalence partitioning, we divide the input data into groups, or partitions, where each group contains a set of equivalent or similar values expected to exhibit similar behaviour in the system under test.

Here are some partitions based on different values:<br>
Partition 1: Valid dates with a day between 1 and 31, a month between 1 and 12, and a year between 1900 and 2015.<br>
Partition 2: Invalid dates with a day less than 1 or greater than 31. Partition 3: Invalid dates with a month less than 1 or greater than 12. Partition 4: Invalid dates with a year less than 1900 or greater than 2015.<br>
Partition 5: Invalid dates with a day that is out of range for a given month (e.g., February 30).<br>
Partition 6: Invalid dates with a day that is out of range for a given year (e.g., February 29 in a non-leap year).<br>

Some sample test cases for different partitions: 
Partition 1: 01/01/2009, 15/03/1990, 31/12/2004 <br>
Partition 2: 00/01/2004, -10/03/2001, 32/12/2000 <br>
Partition 3: 01/00/2001, 15/13/2011, 31/15/2010<br>
Partition 4: 01/01/0000, 15/03/10000, 31/12/99999 <br>
Partition 5: 30/02/2022, 31/04/2023, 28/02/2100 <br>
Partition 6: 29/02/2021, 29/02/1900, 29/02/2100<br>

2.	Boundary Value Analysis<br>
In boundary value analysis, we check for input values near the boundaries of valid and invalid values that are more likely to cause errors. Testing these boundary values can help identify potential problems in the software.

We first identify the boundary values for day, month, and year<br>
●	Day: 1, 28, 29, 30, 31<br>
●	Month: 1, 2, 12<br>
●	Year: 1, 4, 100, 400 (for checking Leap Years).<br>

We then find valid and invalid input ranges for day, month, and year<br>
●	Day: valid input range is from 1 to 31, invalid input range is from 32 to infinity.<br>
●	Month: valid input range is from 1 to 12, invalid input range is from 13 to infinity.<br>
●	Year: valid input range is from 1900 to 2015, invalid range is anything outside that range.<br>
 
Using these to sample generate test cases:<br>
Test case fi: Valid date (boundary value) - Day: 1, Month: 1, Year: 2010<br>
Test case 2: Valid date (boundary value) - Day: 31, Month: 12, Year: 2010<br>
Test case 3: Valid date (boundary value) - Day: 29, Month: 2, Year: 2000 (leap year)<br>
Test case 4: Invalid date (boundary value) - Day: 32, Month: 1, Year: 1990 <br>
Test case 5: Invalid date (boundary value) - Day: 13, Month: 2, Year: 1910 <br>
Test case 6: Invalid date (boundary value) - Day: 30, Month: 2, Year: 1930 <br>
Test case 7: Invalid date (boundary value) - Day: 31, Month: 4, Year: 1930 <br>
Test case 8: Valid date (within valid range) - Day: 15, Month: 6, Year: 2015<br>
Test case 9: Invalid date (day is outside valid range) - Day: 32, Month: 6, Year: 2010<br>
Test case 10: Invalid date (month is outside valid range) - Day: 15, Month: 13, Year: 2010<br>
Test case 11: Invalid date (year is outside valid range) - Day: 15, Month: 6, Year: 2030<br>


#### Code:
```
package tests;
public class Programs{
	int linearSearch(int v, int a[]) { 
		int i = 0;
		while(i < a.length) { 
			if(a[i] == v)
				return (i); 
			i++;
		}
		return (-1);
	}
}
```
